# Local State System
# The application now uses a local state system to track processed emails
# instead of adding flags to emails. This state is stored in:
# ~/.emailfilter/processed_emails.db
#
# You can manage this state using the CLI:
# - View state: python -m emailfilter.cli state view
# - Clean state: python -m emailfilter.cli state clean
# - Reset state: python -m emailfilter.cli state reset
